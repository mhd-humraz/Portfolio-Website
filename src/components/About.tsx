        I'm Humraz, also known as Leo, a BCA student at MES M.K. Mackar Pillay College and the Event Planner of our Computer Science Department Association, BYTE BEGIN.
          I'm passionate about technology, creativity, and leadership, with a strong interest in future tech, backend development, and AI integration.
          Iâ€™ve organized major college events like Nexora, led a disaster management hackathon team, and run a small business called Origin Media,
          which sells wall posters with a brand identity I designed myself. While not deeply into coding, I enjoy solving problems, designing posters using Canva,
          drawing, and I'm planning to learn acoustic guitar. My past as an SPC commander shaped my leadership skills, and I prefer meaningful friendships over large
          circles. I'm constantly exploring ways to combine tech and creativity to make a positive impact..
